This is an undirected dive using [levelgraph](https://github.com/mcollina/levelgraph), a sextuple-indexed graph store which works in the browser. LevelGraph supports complex queries, which might just be awesome for building information-rich interfaces.

## Requirements

cd levelgraph-dive
npm install
